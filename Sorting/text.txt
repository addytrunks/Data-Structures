Why the fuss over sorting?
Why not use the builtin 'sort' method?

The problem arises when there are a large number of data is present, for which using the builtin sort function is not efficient.

Custom sorting methods are required to lower the number of operations and lower the cost.

Different Types of Sorting:
    1. Bubble Sort    ------|
    2. Insertion Sort       | Elementary Sorts
    3. Selection Sort ------|  
        
    4. Merge Sort     ------|     
    5. Quick Sort     ------| Divide and Conquer Sorts


Important to know when to use the sorting algorithms.

When to use what sorting?
    1. Insertion - Only when the data is almost sorted and small
    2. Merge     - If you are worried about worst case.
